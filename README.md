# Sauron

Sauron is the all seeing eye from LOTR. He's supposed to be pure evil but it's the eye part that gave this project
it's working name. This project aims to be a long term training program for eventual ML & NN that can harden defenses,
react to attackers in real time and process events for better training.

## Idea:

This application is not meant to be the end result / product. This is meant to be the training ground for the 
algorithms. The production implementation of this should be written in a systems language and run as close to the
metal as possible.
